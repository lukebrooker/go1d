title: List item actions
lead: List item actions are actions that users can execute on a particular list item. List item actions are most relevant to resource lists where the main job is to to help users find and manage a particular type of item as well as to interact with the item and navigate to a full page representation of it.

List item actions are typically executed through an icon or in-line link.

## Examples

### List item with bulk-select action, in-line links, primary action and action menu

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### List item with in-line links and primary action or action menu

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### List item with primary action and action menu

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### List item with in-line links only

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### List item with primary action only

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### List item with action menu only

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

## Best practice

- All list item actions sit on the far right of the list item unless it is to enter the list for more detail
- All list item actions should fall under an action menu unless quick action is to be enabled from list view. Quick list item actions should be in the style of minimal icon-only buttons.
- In-line links should be distinct from in-line text to signify that it is clickable

## Content guidelines

Copy for list item actions should follow general action content guidelines.
