## Examples

### Page header with default button and action menu

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Page header with default button only

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Page header with default button, action menu and mark as completed button

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

## Best practice

Page actions should follow general best practices for actions

**Page actions should also follow the following:**

- Always align actions with page titles to allow maximum action context
- Always align actions away from the title to the right to keep the page header from looking busy
- Up to two actions should be shown at a time to reduce choice overload and ease task completion
