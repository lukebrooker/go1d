title: Card
lead: Cards are entry points to more detailed information. They're primarily used as a means to display short scannable information to users to help them decide if the card's content is suited to their needs.
---

The contents of a card are inputted by users on the platform. Guidelines for users to make the most of GO1's cards UI could be defined to assist content authors and portal admins with their content.

## Examples

### Course card

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Award card

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Learning item card

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

## Best practice

- Card content should be limited and scannable. Only the most important information before seeing a detailed view should be surfaced to the user
- All content within a card should only relate to one idea
- When possible, include image on card. Image should be used clearly, related to the content and cropped to how it will be seen in a card and overview

## Content guidelines

Copy for cards should be...

- Succinct, specific and searchable
