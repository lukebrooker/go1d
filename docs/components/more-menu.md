title: More menu
lead: The more menu is a dropdown for more actions, typically accessed in a bar of actions and always by a more button. It helps keep secondary actions accessible while reducing visual clutter.
---

It is helpful for uncommon actions that require a more explicit label that can be too long for a button.

The more menu can be found on a bar of actions for a page, screen, section, list item and card.

The standard action menu contains:

- More button to access dropdown
- Dropdown menu of actions

## Examples

### ❗️Action menu only on section or page?

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu with a single page/section/screen action:

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu with two page/section/screen actions:

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu only on a list item:

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu with a list item action:

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu on a card:

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

### Action menu on a card with a quick action

```.jsx
<div> Example to come</div>
```

## Best practice

- Always make action menu visible to improve ease of access across all devices
- Always include icons with the action label in the action menu
- Append actions that are not executed immediately with ellipsis
- Follow verb + noun format when action needs clarification for user (assign learning, enrol learning, add to my learning)
- Only two actions can be shown outside of an action menu within a given area of the product
- Hierarchy of actions:
  - Always list destructive actions last
  - For categorising actions by role, display actions in the following order: learner, admin, author
- Destructive actions are to be marked in red and always fall at the bottom of the list

## Content guidelines

Copy for actions on the dropdown menu should follow general action content guidelines:

- Be succinct, but explicit
- Be clear and distinct
- Use similar labels for similar actions
- Use active rather than passive voice
